# SimpleList
Learning notes from https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKMOdY6Bhga7BUgPca5EX1J-JYQIbX5fn

* Setup C++ in VS code and install extension to compile and make the project

* Use vector to dynamically store a collection of data with same type: vector<string>, push_back()

* Create class: use header file to claim prototype and use .cpp file for function definition

* Git control in VS code

* Read & write file: ofstream, ifstream, getline()

* 2D vector: vector<vector<string>>

* Debugging makefile: change Makefile (CXXFLAGS = -std=c++11 -Wall -g), add debugger configuration json 
  file and change template("program": "${workspaceFolder}/SimpleList", "args": ["Chufan"]), remember to
  clean make before setting breakpoints.
